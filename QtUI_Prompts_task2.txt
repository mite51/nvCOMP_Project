Zero manual Qt installation required!
2. Automatic Qt Deployment
windeployqt runs automatically after build
Deploys all Qt DLLs, plugins, and resources
Executable is immediately runnable!
3. Complete Application Structure
Main window with menu bar (File, Help)
About dialog (F1)
Exit action (Ctrl+Q)
Application icons (7 sizes)
Comprehensive test suite (11 tests)
Files Created
