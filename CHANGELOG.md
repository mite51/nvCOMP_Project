# Changelog

All notable changes to the nvCOMP CLI project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added
- **Algorithm Auto-Detection** for Decompression and Listing Modes
  - Algorithm parameter is now **optional** for `-d` (decompress) and `-l` (list) modes
  - Tool automatically reads algorithm ID from GPU batched format file headers
  - Works for LZ4, Snappy, and Zstd in both GPU and CPU modes
  - Example: `nvcomp_cli -d archive.zstd output/` (no algorithm needed!)
  - Example: `nvcomp_cli -l archive.lz4` (no algorithm needed!)
  
- **New Helper Function**: `detectAlgorithmFromFile()`
  - Reads batched format header from file
  - Extracts algorithm ID without loading entire file
  - Returns ALGO_UNKNOWN for non-batched format files
  
- **Enhanced User Experience**:
  - Updated CLI usage message with clear indication of optional parameters
  - Better error messages when algorithm is required (compression mode)
  - Auto-detection status messages ("Auto-detected algorithm: lz4")

### Changed
- **CLI Argument Parsing**:
  - Algorithm parameter changed from required to optional for `-d` and `-l` modes
  - Compression mode (`-c`) still requires algorithm parameter (as expected)
  - Defaults to ALGO_LZ4 fallback if auto-detection fails
  
- **Decompression Functions**:
  - `decompressGPUBatched()`: Now auto-detects algorithm before processing
  - `decompressCPU()`: Now auto-detects algorithm before processing
  - `listCompressedArchive()`: Now auto-detects algorithm before processing
  - `decompressBatchedFormat()`: Updated log message to show "Auto-detected algorithm"

### Testing
- **6 New Auto-Detection Tests** added to folder test suite:
  - 3 listing tests (LZ4, Snappy, Zstd) without algorithm parameter
  - 3 decompression tests (LZ4 GPU, Zstd GPU, LZ4 CPU) without algorithm parameter
  - All tests verify successful auto-detection and correct operation
  
- **Total Test Coverage**: 29 tests (15 single-file + 14 folder/archive)
  - Single-file tests: 15 (unchanged)
  - Folder compression: 4 tests
  - Archive listing: 3 tests
  - Round-trip test: 1 test
  - **Auto-detection: 6 tests (NEW)**

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with algorithm auto-detection examples
- Updated usage documentation to show optional parameters
- Added dedicated "Algorithm Auto-Detection" section
- Updated all example commands to show auto-detection usage
- Updated test coverage numbers (8 → 14 folder tests, 23 → 29 total)

### Benefits
- **Simplified User Experience**: No need to remember or specify algorithm for decompression
- **Backward Compatible**: Explicit algorithm parameter still works as before
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents mismatches between file format and specified algorithm

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- **GPU Batched Decompression**: Implemented GPU batched decompression for LZ4, Snappy, Zstd
  - Added custom batched compression format with magic number `NVBC`
  - Stores chunk metadata (uncompressed size, chunk count, chunk sizes)
  - Enables GPU decompression with proper chunk boundary handling
  - Cross-compatible: CPU can still decompress GPU-compressed files (but slower)
  - **Original Issue Fixed**: "Error: Zstd CPU decompression failed" when listing or decompressing GPU-compressed archives
  
- **Decompression Mode Selection**:
  - Removed forced CPU decompression for cross-compatible algorithms
  - GPU decompression now used by default when GPU is available
  - Automatic format detection (batched format vs CPU format)
  - `--cpu` flag still works to force CPU decompression

- **List Mode Format Detection**:
  - Automatically detects batched format vs standard format
  - Uses appropriate decompression method based on file format
  - Works with both GPU and CPU compressed files

### Added
- **Algorithm Auto-Detection** for GPU batched format files
  - Reads algorithm from file header automatically
  - No need to specify algorithm when listing or decompressing GPU batched files
  - Works for LZ4, Snappy, and Zstd
  - Example: `nvcomp_cli -l archive.zstd` (no algorithm parameter needed)

- **Folder Compression Test Suite** (`test_folder.bat`, `test_folder.sh`)
  - 8 comprehensive tests for folder compression and archive operations
  - Tests for GPU and CPU compression of folders (LZ4, Zstd)
  - Tests for archive listing functionality
  - Dedicated round-trip test that reproduces and validates fix for original zstd issue
  - All tests pass successfully

### Changed
- **Batched Compression Output**:
  - Now includes metadata header with chunk information
  - Slightly larger files (metadata overhead ~32 bytes + 8 bytes per chunk)
  - Enables much faster GPU decompression
  
- **Performance**:
  - GPU decompression now works for Zstd, LZ4, Snappy (was forcing CPU before)
  - Significant speed improvement for decompression on GPU

### Technical Details
- **Batched Header Structure**:
  - Magic: 0x4E564243 ("NVBC")
  - Version: 1
  - Uncompressed size, chunk count, chunk size, algorithm ID
  - Followed by array of chunk sizes
  - Then compressed chunk data

- **Format Detection**:
  - Checks magic number to determine format
  - Batched format → GPU decompression (or CPU if --cpu flag)
  - Standard format → CPU decompression

### Testing
- **Original Issue Test**: Round-trip test validates the fix for GPU zstd decompression failure
  - Step 1: Compress folder with GPU zstd
  - Step 2: List archive (was failing: "Error: Zstd CPU decompression failed")
  - Step 3: Decompress archive (was also failing)
  - Step 4: Verify extracted files
  - ✅ All steps now pass successfully

### Breaking Changes
- Files compressed with previous version (2.1.0) cannot be decompressed with this version
- Recompress your archives with the new version for GPU decompression support

    - Functions: `nvcompBatchedLZ4CompressAsync`, etc.
    - Produces **raw compressed data** compatible with CPU libraries
    - Enables GPU compress → CPU decompress and vice versa
  - Successfully tested cross-compatibility for all three algorithms

### Fixed
- **API Compatibility Issues** (nvCOMP 5.1.0):
  - Corrected function names: Added "Async" suffix (`nvcompBatchedLZ4CompressGetTempSizeAsync`)
  - Fixed option constants: Changed to `nvcompBatchedLZ4CompressDefaultOpts` (with "Compress")
  - Fixed Manager constructors: Added both compress and decompress options
  - Added missing header: `nvcomp/nvcompManagerFactory.hpp`
  - Fixed function signatures: Added `nullptr` status pointer parameter before stream
  - Added total input size parameter to `GetTempSizeAsync` functions

- **Build System**
  - Fixed CMake minimum version conflicts by patching fetched dependencies
  - Resolved CUDA architecture targeting (75, 80, 86, 89, 90)
  - Fixed linker warnings (LIBCMT conflicts - non-critical, common in CUDA projects)

### Changed
- **Chunk Management**: Implemented 64KB chunking for batched API (required for cross-compatibility)
- **File Format**: Cross-compatible algorithms produce raw format (concatenated chunks), GPU-only algorithms use nvCOMP container
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages with line numbers and algorithm context
- **Performance Reporting**: Improved throughput calculation and formatting

### Technical Details
- **Two Different Implementations**:
  - **Implementation A (Batched API)**: For LZ4, Snappy, Zstd - produces standard format
  - **Implementation B (Manager API)**: For GDeflate, ANS, Bitcomp - produces nvCOMP format
- **Why Two Implementations?**: Batched API enables CPU interoperability at the cost of complexity; Manager API is simpler but GPU-only
- **Chunking**: Data split into 64KB chunks for batched processing, enabling better GPU utilization

### Known Limitations
- GPU batched decompression not implemented (requires chunk metadata storage)
- Files larger than GPU memory not supported (no streaming implementation yet)
- Default compression levels used (no level configuration exposed)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- **Command Line Interface (`nvcomp_cli`)**
  - Implemented a C++ CLI application (`main.cu`) using the nvCOMP High-Level C++ API.
  - **Compression**:
    - Support for multiple GPU-accelerated algorithms: LZ4, GDeflate, Snappy, ANS, Cascaded, and Bitcomp.
    - Default algorithm set to LZ4.
    - Automatic resource management (GPU memory allocation, stream synchronization).
  - **Decompression**:
    - Automatic format detection using `nvcomp::create_manager`.
    - Support for decompressing any valid nvCOMP high-level stream.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Reports compressed size, compression ratio, and execution time (including throughput in GB/s).

- **Build System**
  - Added `CMakeLists.txt` for cross-platform build configuration.
  - Configured to link against local nvCOMP 5.1 library (`nvcomp-windows-x86_64-5.1.0.21_cuda13`).
  - Added post-build steps to automatically copy required DLLs (`nvcomp64_5.dll`, `nvcomp_cpu64_5.dll`) to the output directory.

- **Documentation**
  - Added `README.md` with build instructions, prerequisites, and usage examples.

### Fixed
- Resolved compilation errors related to missing default options for GDeflate, Snappy, ANS, Cascaded, and Bitcomp managers by updating constructor calls to match nvCOMP 5.1 headers.
- Fixed a runtime crash caused by improper destruction order of `nvcompManager` and `cudaStream_t` (ensured manager is destroyed before the stream).

### Notes
- The current implementation loads entire files into memory; files larger than available GPU memory are not yet supported (requires chunked streaming implementation).
- GPU-only implementation; requires NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 6.0+ and CUDA drivers.
