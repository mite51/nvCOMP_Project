# Task 3.1: Archive Viewer - Submission Summary

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

## What Was Delivered

**Archive Viewer Dialog** - A professional file browser for viewing and extracting archive contents, similar to WinRAR/7-Zip.

### Files Created (3)
- `gui/src/archive_viewer.h` (267 lines)
- `gui/src/archive_viewer.cpp` (810 lines) 
- `gui/ui/archive_viewer.ui` (215 lines)

### Files Modified (4)
- `gui/src/mainwindow.{h,cpp}` - Tools menu integration, double-click support
- `gui/ui/mainwindow.ui` - Added Tools menu with Ctrl+V shortcut
- `gui/CMakeLists.txt` - Build system integration
- `gui/tests/test_mainwindow.cpp` - Added 7 test cases

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Archive Format Support**
  - Compressed archives (NVBC) - auto-decompresses to read contents
  - Uncompressed archives (NVAR) - direct read
  - Multi-volume archive detection

- **User Interface**
  - Tree view with folders/files hierarchy
  - 4 columns: Name, Size, Compressed Size, Ratio
  - Real-time search/filter
  - Multi-select (Ctrl/Shift+Click)
  - Right-click context menu
  - Statistics bar (file count, sizes, compression ratio)

- **Extraction**
  - Extract All button
  - Extract Selected button (enabled on selection)
  - Progress feedback
  - Maintains folder structure

- **Integration**
  - Tools → View Archive (Ctrl+V)
  - Double-click .nvcomp files in main window
  - Background loading (non-blocking UI)

## Technical Implementation

**Architecture:** QDialog with QThread background loader, QTreeWidget display, nvCOMP C API for decompression

**Key Design Decision:** Compressed archives are fully decompressed to a temporary directory to read the file list, then temp files are automatically cleaned up. This is necessary because NVBC format compresses the entire archive as one block.

**Qt6 Compatibility:** Updated from deprecated `QRegExp` to `QRegularExpression`

## Testing

**Test Results:** 36/36 tests passed (7 new archive viewer tests)
- UI element validation
- Archive loading
- Search functionality
- Integration with main window

**Manual Testing:** Verified with compressed/uncompressed archives, extraction, search, error handling, multi-volume detection.

## Known Limitations

1. Compressed archives require full decompression to view (NVBC format limitation)
2. Per-file compressed sizes are estimated (format doesn't store individual sizes)
3. Requires temporary disk space equal to uncompressed size (auto-cleaned)

## Build Status

✅ Compiles without errors or warnings  
✅ All tests pass  
✅ Ready for production use

## Usage

```
Tools → View Archive (Ctrl+V)
or
Double-click any .nvcomp file
```
